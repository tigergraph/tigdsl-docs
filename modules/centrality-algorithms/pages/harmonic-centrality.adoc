****

Harmonic Centrality is a variant of Closeness Centrality. In a (not necessarily connected) graph, the *harmonic centrality* reverses the sum and reciprocal operations in the definition of closeness centrality:

[stem]
++++
H(x)=\sum _{y\neq x}{\frac {1}{d(x,y)}}
++++

The Harmonic Centrality algorithm calculates a harmonic centrality score for each vertex in the graph.

CREATE QUERY harmonic_cent(SET<STRING> v_type, SET<STRING> e_type,
    SET<STRING> re_type,INT max_hops=10, INT top_k=100,
    BOOL wf = TRUE,BOOL print_accum = True, STRING result_attr = "",
    STRING file_path = "", BOOL display_edges = FALSE)

=== Time complexity
The algorithm has a time complexity of stem:[O(E)], where stem:[E] is the number of edges.

Parallel processing reduces the time needed for computation.


== Results

Returns a centrality score for all vertices of the specified type in the graph.
The results are ordered from most central to least central.

There is an optional parameter, `top_k`, that limits the results to an arbitrary number of vertices with the highest centrality scores in the graph.
This can be useful for larger graphs, since in large graphs there are likely to be many vertices with very low centrality.

The maximum result size is equal to stem:[V], the number of vertices, because one centrality score is calculated for each vertex.

== Parameters

| (empty string)

| `STRING file_path`
| If not empty, write output to this file in CSV.
| (empty string)

== Example
If we have the following graph, we can see that Ivy is the most central of the five vertices. Running the algorithm on the graph shows that Ivy has the highest centrality score:
